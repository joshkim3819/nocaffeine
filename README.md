# nocaffeine.py

The background for this project requires the knowledge that I was a student athlete during my undergraduate years. As a swimmer, we had 5am morning practices twice a week. This lead to my caffeine addiction. It got really bad, so I decided to create this program

nocaffeine.py is a program that used my school computer's camera to count how many sips of coffee I took during a study session.

This was my first ever python coding project, so I used a lot of articles to help me understand functionality.
